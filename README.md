# Fixed Income Modeling: Zero-Coupon Bonds and Swaption Pricing

This repository presents a comprehensive Jupyter notebook that delves into fixed income modeling, specifically focusing on zero-coupon bond pricing, forward rate derivation, and swaption pricing using the Hull-White model. Developed collaboratively by Mart√≠n Pasche and Hugo Yeremian, the notebook serves as both an educational resource and a practical toolkit for fixed income analysis.

## üìò Notebook Overview

* **Title**: Fixed-Income-Yeremian-Pasche.ipynb
* **Authors**: Mart√≠n Pasche, Hugo Yeremian
* **Language**: Python 3
* **Libraries Used**:

  * `pandas`
  * `numpy`
  * `scipy`
  * `matplotlib`
  * `dataclasses`

## üßæ Contents

The notebook is structured into the following sections:

### 1. Zero-Coupon Bond Pricing and Forward Rate Derivation

* Bootstrapping techniques to construct the zero-coupon yield curve from market data.
* Calculation of forward rates implied by the zero-coupon curve.
* Visualization of the term structure of interest rates.

### 2. Swaption Pricing Using the Hull-White Model

* Calibration of the Hull-White model parameters to market swaption prices.
* Pricing of European swaptions using the calibrated model.

## üöÄ Getting Started
